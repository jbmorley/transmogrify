# Transmogrify

Written in anticipation of the Apple TV, Transmogrify is solution for transcoding movies into a iPod, iTunes and Apple TV suitable formats using OS X Folder Actions. It is a collection of Perl, AppleScript and some native C which automatically converts most movies dropped into a folder to mp4 files.

Thanks must go to Thomas Sutcliffe for writing the C utility which sets the folder icons.

The script contains ffmpeg, the project page for which can be found [here](http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/).

## Installation

1. Install the package.
2. Once installed, just open the &lsquo;Folder Actions Setup&rsquo; dialog and add the Transmogrify script to the desired folder.
